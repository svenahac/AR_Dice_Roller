<h1>How To Use AR Dice Roller</h1>

1. In the menu, click on the dice icon and select the number and type of dice you want to throw and click apply.
2. Click the refresh button in the bottom right then click Roll
   ! Make sure the surface infront of you is clear and well lit, you may need to refresh a couple times to get the dice positioned nicely !
4. You can check the stats of your roll by clicking the button on bottom left.

NOTICE: In the menu, there is a separate statistics page, but unfortunately we didn't manage to implement the logic.
